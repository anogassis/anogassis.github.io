# Ideas

This document holds a bunch of ideas for new posts.

- [ ] Eren Jaeger and mesa-optimization: discuss how Eren Jaeger from Attack on Titan was a deceptively aligned mesa-optimizer.
- [ ] Neighborhood Academy Arm Wrestling exercise: post about two human agents given the goal to win as many arm wrestling matches as possible. Discuss how the best solution would be both humans cooperating for quick and easy matches to get M&Ms. However, all students failed to see this outcome.
- [ ] SCRUM training: sort all colors of legos in a pile. create a pile for special colors. Talk about how one group interpreted the goal as "sort broad color categories" vs the other groups "sort all unique color categories".
